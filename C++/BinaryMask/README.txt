Exercise: define a class binarymask and perform mask erosion, dilation and close gaps

The mask is implemented as an array of integers.
All three methods are implemented in the class.
In main.C a .bin file is saved after each operation to see the effect of each method.
NOTE: in the final image black = mask, white = not mask.

The script convert.sh can be run to convert all .bin files in images with GraphicsMagick
