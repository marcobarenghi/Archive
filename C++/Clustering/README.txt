Exercise: label the clusters of a binary matrix and count regions.

The matrices (in reality arrays) are randomly filled with 0 and 1 with loadMatrix
The matrices can be clustered and labelled with clustering(). The 4th entry is a boolean flag: true -> 4-connectivity, false -> 8-connectivity. Both cases are displayed.
clustering call doUnion and unionCoords.

getNumberOfRegions is used to count the clusters.
