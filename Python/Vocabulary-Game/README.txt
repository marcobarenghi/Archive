Interactive vobulary (German - Italina) to learn words.
Input files in folder: vocab
NOTE: keep the same syntax if you want to add more words!
Outputfile: progressFile (append mode)
NOTE: This is just an example, feel free to delete it.

A class VocabGame is created. 
The list of words is loaded with setGame(). The use can choose the files to load (nous, adjectives, verbs...)
The game start with playGame() -> words are randomly picked and the user has two possibilities to guess the correct translation.
The printResults() gives you the score
updateHistory() updates the output file with date and score (out of 100)
displayProgress() plot all previous scores

A method displayStatistics() with cool features will be added.

This could become a cool GUI
