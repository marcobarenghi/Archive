Plot covid statistics of multiple countries to compare trends and printing vaccinations statistics.

Data are imported with Pandas from: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data
Two datasets were necessary to get clean data regarding new Covid cases and vaccinations.

The user can define list of countries to compare. The EU statistics are set by default and are always displayed, even if the list is empty.

This could become a cool GUI (as in OurWOrldInData)
