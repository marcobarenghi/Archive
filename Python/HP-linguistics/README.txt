run with:
./main.py (or python3 ./main.py)

Linguistic exercise -> test Heap's law and Zip's law with HP book
Additional point: plot histogram of recurrences of spells in the entire saga

In funcions.py one can find all functions for reading and unify .txt file, plus the functions for Zipf's & Heap's law, and the recurrency function.
In the folder text you can find the necessary inputs.

NOTE1: This is computationally quite heavy, to run the entire main requires (to me) about 30 min.
Zipf's law is the fastest to run.

NOTE2: Code will be cleaned
